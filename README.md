# tic_tac_toe_console

A clean, fully interactive two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Dart for the command line.

This project is part of a Dart assessment and demonstrates how to build a simple turn-based game using object-oriented design, input validation, and console I/O. The goal was to apply Dart fundamentals in a real-world use case.
